The vertical axis can roughly reference the richness of information associated to each participant (scalar, vector, semi-structured text, natural language, single sense, multisensory, proprioception, telepathy) and the horizontal can roughly index the number of randomly chosen full participant human equivalents in orders of magnitude from just a few to billions and beyond.","choices":["prioritize"],"strategy":"qv","participants_group":"everybody","frozen":false,"closed":false,"cancelled":false,"parent_commit":"e23464a3d9b7a3b82b9888b7bb0204ffed873ede"},"ballot_elections":[{"vote_id":"d4y23imoqj6z7zbuftlbkpgdvob3dz6wrnwt2fg2focou3th6icq","vote_time":"2023-11-04T17:19:49.0810489-04:00","vote_choice":"prioritize","vote_strength_change":169}]}]}
